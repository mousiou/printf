Certainly, you can rephrase the project description in a GitHub-friendly format as follows:

**Project Title:** printf Project

**Description:**
This team project is a part of the first-year curriculum at ALX. The goal is to create a custom implementation of the `printf()` function from the C standard library.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how to use Git in a team setting.
- Apply variadic functions to a substantial project.
- Understand the complexities of the `printf` function.
- Manage a large number of files and establish an effective workflow.

**Prototype:**
```c
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

**Usage:**
- The `_printf` function is designed to print a formatted string to the standard output.
- It should return the number of characters in the output string on success and -1 in case of an error.
- Call the function using the following format:
  ```c
  _printf("format string", arguments...);
  ```
  where the format string can contain conversion specifiers, flags, and regular characters.

**Examples:**
- `_printf("Hello, main\n")` prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line.
- `_printf("%s", "Hello")` prints "Hello".
- `_printf("This is a number: %d", 98)` prints "This is a number: 98".

**Note:**
- All source files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`.
